# Configuring GitHub Credentials

Sets up git, GitHub CLI, SSH keys, and git configuration on a Linux VM.

## Progress checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
- [ ] Install git and GitHub CLI
- [ ] Prompt user for GitHub username
- [ ] Authenticate to GitHub CLI
- [ ] Verify GitHub CLI connectivity
- [ ] Generate SSH key
- [ ] Configure SSH for GitHub
- [ ] Upload SSH public key to GitHub
- [ ] Verify SSH connectivity
- [ ] Configure git globals
- [ ] Set up project repository
```

## Step 1: Install git and GitHub CLI

Detect the Linux distribution and install packages with the native package manager. See [references/package-managers.md](references/package-managers.md) for distro-specific commands.

```bash
. /etc/os-release && echo "Distro: $ID"
```

Check if `git` and `gh` are already installed before attempting installation:

```bash
command -v git && echo "git: installed" || echo "git: missing"
command -v gh && echo "gh: installed" || echo "gh: missing"
```

Install only what is missing, using the commands from the package manager reference for the detected distro.

## Step 2: Prompt for GitHub username

Ask the user which GitHub account to use. Recommend using an account with limited permissions (not a personal account with org admin access) since the credentials will live on the VM.

**Important:** Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

## Step 3: Authenticate to GitHub CLI

**Primary method — Device flow (OAuth):**

**Important:** This command must be run as a background task so the output streams properly. Running it inline with `2>&1` will not display the URL and code.

```bash
# Run in background — do NOT run inline
gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol ssh --web --scopes admin:public_key
```

The `--scopes admin:public_key` flag is required so that Step 7 (`gh ssh-key add`) has permission to upload SSH keys. Without it, the default OAuth scopes will not include this and you will need to re-authenticate.

Use `run_in_background: true` when calling the Bash tool. Then read the output to find the one-time code and URL. Present both to the user clearly:

> Open this URL in any browser: https://github.com/login/device
> Enter this code: XXXX-XXXX

Wait for the user to confirm they completed the browser flow.

**Fallback — Personal access token:**

If the device flow fails or the user prefers a token:

1. Ask the user to create a PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens with the scopes: `repo`, `read:org`, `admin:public_key`
2. Ask the user to provide the token
3. Authenticate:

```bash
echo "<TOKEN>" | gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol ssh --with-token
```

## Step 4: Verify GitHub CLI connectivity

```bash
gh auth status
```

Confirm the output shows the expected username and authentication method. If it fails, return to Step 3.

## Step 5: Generate SSH key

Generate an ed25519 key specifically for GitHub:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/github_ed25519 -N "" -C "claude-code-vm"
```

Set correct permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub
```

If `~/.ssh/github_ed25519` already exists, ask the user whether to overwrite or reuse the existing key.

## Step 6: Configure SSH for GitHub

Add a host entry to `~/.ssh/config` (create the file if needed):

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_ed25519
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Set permissions on the config file:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

If `~/.ssh/config` already has a `github.com` entry, ask the user before modifying it.

## Step 7: Upload SSH public key to GitHub

```bash
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/github_ed25519.pub --title "claude-code-vm-$(hostname)-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

The title includes the hostname and date for easy identification in GitHub settings.

## Step 8: Verify SSH connectivity

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
```

Expected output: `Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated...`

If this fails, review Steps 5-7 for issues.

## Step 9: Configure git globals

Check if `user.name` and `user.email` are already set:

```bash
git config --global user.name || echo "NOT SET"
git config --global user.email || echo "NOT SET"
```

If not set, ask the user what name and email to use for git commits. The git commit identity may differ from the GitHub account username (e.g., a dedicated CI/bot identity). Suggest the GitHub noreply email format as a default:

```bash
git config --global user.name "<name>"
git config --global user.email "<name>@users.noreply.github.com"
```

Verify the configuration was applied:

```bash
git config --global user.name && git config --global user.email
```

## Step 10: Set up project repository

Ask the user which repository to use for their work. Options:

1. **Clone an existing repo** — ask for the repo name (e.g., `owner/repo-name`):
   ```bash
   gh repo clone <owner/repo-name>
   ```

2. **Create a new repo** — ask for the desired name and visibility:
   ```bash
   gh repo create <name> --private --clone
   ```

All source code written by Claude should be committed to this repo and pushed to GitHub.
