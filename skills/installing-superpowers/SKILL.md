# Installing Superpowers

Ensures the [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) plugin collection is installed in Claude Code.

## Progress checklist

Copy and track progress:

```
- [ ] Check if superpowers is already installed
- [ ] Install superpowers if missing
- [ ] Verify installation succeeded
- [ ] Notify user that a restart is needed (if newly installed)
```

## Step 1: Check if superpowers is installed

Check for the directory `~/.claude/plugins/cache/superpowers-marketplace`:

```bash
test -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/superpowers-marketplace && echo "INSTALLED" || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

If `INSTALLED`, skip to Step 3 (verification).

## Step 2: Install superpowers

Run these two commands in sequence:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

```bash
claude plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

If either command fails, report the error to the user and stop.

## Step 3: Verify installation

Confirm the plugin directory now exists:

```bash
test -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/superpowers-marketplace && echo "SUCCESS" || echo "FAILED"
```

If `FAILED`, report the error to the user. Otherwise, installation is complete.

## Step 4: Restart notice

If superpowers was newly installed, inform the user that a Claude Code restart is needed for the plugin to take effect. However, **do not stop the current session** — other tasks that don't depend on superpowers skills (e.g., configuring GitHub credentials) can continue in this session.

If this skill was invoked as part of bootstrapping-vm, continue with the remaining bootstrap steps. The restart happens at the end after all setup is complete.

Superpowers skills will only be available after the restart.
